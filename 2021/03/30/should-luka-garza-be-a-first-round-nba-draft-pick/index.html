<p>I was doing a little bit of research over the potential draft prospects and I noticed that Luka Garza wasn’t ranked as high as I thought he would be. For those who don’t know, Garza is currently ranked no. 1 in College Men’s Basketball. He is projected to be in the late-first to mid-second round of NBA draft picks. How is it possible that Luka Garza is currently ranked no. 1 in the nation but won’t be a first round NBA draft pick? Hopefully by looking at his statistics we will be able to figure out what skills he might be lacking.</p>

<p>I have pulled data and filtered it to show the players who have at least 800 minutes played and a 3-Point Field Goal Percentage of at least .4. This data contains the top 57 players that fit into that criteria. I am going to clean up the player names and name the data frame ‘top57’.</p>

<p>Now that the data is loaded, let’s see how Luka’s 3-point average and 3-point attempts compare to the top 57 players in Men’s College Basketball for the 2020-21 season. I want to get to the bottom of where Luka ranks against other players when we compare these two stats.</p>

Interestingly enough, Garza is sitting toward the bottom of this scatter plot because he hasn’t gone for as many shots as some of the other top players. He still has a good 3-Point Field Goal Percentage because of his accuracy but there are other players that have taken substantially more shots and made them.</p>
<p>I am going to make a data frame containing the players from my Top 57 data frame but I am going to filter out all other schools so I can compare Luka Ganza to the players who are in the Power Five schools. ets look at the rebound stats on a dumbbell plot including the Power 5 schools:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rebounds &lt;- top57 %&gt;%
  group_by(Player, Conf) %&gt;%
  filter(Conf == &quot;Big Ten&quot; | Conf == &quot;ACC&quot; | Conf == &quot;Big 12&quot; | Conf == &quot;Pac-12&quot; | Conf == &quot;SEC&quot;) %&gt;%
  summarise(
    OffensiveRebounds = sum(ORB), 
    DefensiveRebounds = sum(DRB))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;Player&#39;. You can override using the `.groups` argument.</code></pre>
<p>Since Luka Garza is a heavier basketball player (6’11" and 265 pounds), I thought it would be interesting to compare his offensive and defensive rebounds against that of the other players on a dumbbell plot. The blue dots are the offensive rebounds and the red dots are the defensive rebounds.</p>

It’s not incredibly shocking that Garza has the highest number of offensive and defensive rebounds since he has such a broad build and plays extremely rough. His statistics will look good when the NBA is drafting players, but are impressive rebounds enough to secure a spot?</p>
<p>On this next chart I am going to compare Garza’s total field goals and field goal attempts to the top 57 college players with the size of the bubble representing points. Being able to shoot the ball and make it with accuracy looks good to the NBA so let’s see how he stands out.</p>

Luka Garza ends up at the top. He has the highest amount of field goals, field goal attempts, and total points.</p>
